*squeak squeak*
|i am rat *squeak* i promise *squeak squeak*
|look at my beautiful rat costume.... I mean skin *squeak*
|i love rats, they're, i mean we're, so cool
|we eat garbage, spread disease and do what we want
|hey whataya say we get outta here *squeak*
|the people don't understand us rats
|i got some string, all we need is money and we can get away from these pesky humans
|share everything and live our free ways
|how about that? *squeak*
