Ever just stare at the sky and wonder what's beyond
|Or stare at a person and wonder what they've got going on
|Life is beautiful in a way
|The poetic nature of a rainy day
|To the cleary blue skies when everything is okay
|All my life I've turned strife and pain to paint
|The pen is the building of the heart
|The zen comes from the gilding of art
|Yet a pen I must receive
|Achieve obtaining a pen and I will leave you with these mushrooms I retrieved
|I believe we've met for a reason, but for now take leave!
