A rat?
|Talking to me?
|Hello there rat.
|You want string
|I guess we both want something then
|I seem to have lost my car keys, and i need to pick up some dog food from the store
|If you can help me find my keys I'll be happy to share some string with you
|Wow this is still very weird, I can't believe I'm talking to a rat
