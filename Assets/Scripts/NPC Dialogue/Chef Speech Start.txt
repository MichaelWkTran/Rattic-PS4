Bonjour rat!
|As a little ratling I always wanted to be a rat chef
|I'm now living my dreams
|But no one trusts a rat like me with the ingredients I need
|So instead I dumpster dive
|I found this orange the other day...
|... but it won't go with this dish, plus it looks a little green
|what i need is...
|i'm getting a hint of
|MUSHROOMS!
|If you can share some mushrooms with me I'll share my orange with you, it might be a little moldy but it's perfectly healthy
