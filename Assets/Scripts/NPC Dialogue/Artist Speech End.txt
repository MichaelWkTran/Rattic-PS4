You have joined my presence yet again.
|Oh and wonderful you have gathered a pen!
|And you turned up in such a dash
|The speed of which is like whiplash.
|In return I shall share my mushroom stash.
|You are an unsung hero I wish I met earlier
|Alas our amity has only just begun. 
|Now good day young journeyer
|For I wish you well.
