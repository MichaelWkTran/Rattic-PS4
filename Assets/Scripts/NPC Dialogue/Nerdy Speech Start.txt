Please help me. I'm trying to figure out how when a rat jumps from a window sill they go down.
|Can you help with that?
|No?!...
|I'm surrounded by idiots
|At least could you get me a cracker.
|I never have time for food anymore with all the thinking I do.
|I want to share my knowledge with the world.
|I could also share a pen if you get me that cracker!
